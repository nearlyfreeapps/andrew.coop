<h4>SMART Goals</h4>
Early in my work term semester, I set some unique goals for myself that I would attempt to achieve. These goals were highly correlated to my role as an Operations Developer at Polar Mobile and dealt with certain skills that I truly wanted to develop.<br><br>

In order to ensure that my goals were realistic and manageable I used the SMART guideline in that each goal is Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time targeted. Below I have outlined each goal and the corresponding status.<br><br>

<h4>Oral Communication</h4>
This particular goal is actaully a carry-over from the previous work term. While I did feel that I made a lot of progress last semester, going into a brand new company (and getting out of my comfort zone) proved to reconfirm that this was something that I needed to work on. This particular skill appears to be one of the most important when working in small teams. Communicating effectively goes a long way and tends to make all projects run smoother. The specific goal that I set out to achieve was to be confident and comfortable talking about my projects in a small group.<br><br>

In order to accomplish this goal, I decided that I would go out of my way to initiative conversation regarding the projects that I was working on. More often than not, this revealed new insights and particular use cases that I would not have thought of myself. I asked a lot of questions but this definitely sped the process along and meant I got the chance to work on many different things. Certainly, oral communication is still something that I can continue to improve but I feel like I made some great strides. One particular situation that shows this is that I had the opportunity to give a presentation about the project I was working on to the entire company at Demo Day. I found that trying to stress less prior to the presentation allowed me to perform better overall.<br><br>

<h4>Managing Tasks - Organizing & Planning</h4>
In my first couple weeks at Polar Mobile, a project manager asked me the following question: "How long will it take you to finish?". My reply at the time was "Good question". I realized that I wasn't accurately able to give an estimation and this was something that bothered me and that I decided to combat. In order to answer that question, I needed to be able to plan out and organize each project that I worked on, so this became the foundation for a second goal that I would achieve during my placement.<br><br>

To accomplish this goal, my action plan was to establish what I wanted to get done each day when I arrived at the office. This allowed me to be able to gauge how closely I was able to follow the plan and estimate how long features and projects would take me to complete. I was quick to realize that this would not only be a skill that I would benefit from but also would allow the company to plan accordingly, which is very important for meeting deadlines. I can quite happily say that I feel that I have achieved this goal in that I am now able to determine how long a given project will take based on its description or specification. If nothing else, this should be extremely helpful in my academic studies.<br><br>

<h4>Managing Self - Learning</h4>

A third and final goal that I decided to tackle this past semester was that of essentially absorbing as many new technologies and programming languages that I could. One thing that became very obvious to be when I arrived at Polar Mobile was that I had a lot to learn. I was introduced to a variety of new concepts and technologies that I had really never heard of before and that fuelled me to take in as much as possible. I felt that this goal would serve me well in the future in that it would strengthen my ability to choose the right tool for the job. The specific goal that I wanted to achieve was to become well versed in the tools that I was using frequently: Python, Django, Git and Buildout.<br><br>

Although this goal was slightly open ended, I feel as though I made a significant dent in conquering it. By putting my plan into action of actively researching and reading documentation pertaining to these new languages and frameworks, I feel well versed and comfortable using the above tools to take projects from start to finish. One thing that I really was able to gain from this was that searching out the right tool can be an immense time saver. I appreciate the exposure that I received to so many young and booming technologies that I likely would not have had the opportunity to work on, had I worked at a different organization. I touch on some of the core technologies used by Polar Mobile in the <a href="/portfolio/polarmobile/technology">Technology</a> section.
