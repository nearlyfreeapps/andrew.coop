            "content": "In many respects, comparing my first work term at Voice On The Go with my second work term at Polar Mobile is a difficult task. Polar Mobile is an organization of over double the size of Voice On The Go and it certainly felt that way. In general there were many more hoops to jump through in order to get your code to see with light of day. At Voice On The Go, I always had a clear understanding of who is in charge of what particular aspect of a task. At Polar Mobile, this was lost me. There were times when I had completed a project and I wasn't sure who to report to or what happens next.<br><br>\r\n\r\nHowever, with this extensive process comes great things as well. Since the project changed hands several times, it often would collect a lot of feedback and testing. The code review process at Polar Mobile is something I cannot say enough about. I really did enjoy getting the constructive criticism given that it would improve my code style and thinking regarding certain problems. At Voice On The Go, there was no formal code review process. There seemed to be more of a mentality of \"as long as it works\" where as at Polar Mobile the mentality is \"as long as it is quality\". I really did appreciate that particular mentality because it taught me to not rush my code just to meet deadlines but rather focus on the issue at hand and develop a lasting, maintainable solution that is absent of any ugly hacks. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe overall atmosphere of both organizations was also very much different. Being a small organization, Voice On The Go felt like a close, tight-knit group of people. Polar Mobile, on the other hand, felt slightly more divided by various department or team (which is natural as an organization grows). While I enjoyed my time at Voice On The Go, much of that was due to me making the situation enjoyable. Most came in to get their work done and that was that. At Polar Mobile, they have a very big focus on working hard and playing hard. I was told that precise statement during my interview and it was apparent on my first day. The level of dedication and investment that each person put into projects was very refreshing.<br><br>\r\n\r\nTo wrap up, both of my work term experiences so far have been magnificent. Each placement taught me a very similar set of skills and I believe each subsequent work term will continue building on those from the past. At Voice On The Go, I got to greatly deepen my appreciation and fondness for the iOS platform and at Polar Mobile I got to learn an entirely new technology stack. Looking back, I wouldn't change anything about either work term and <i>the experience was truly invaluable</i>. ",

            "content": "While I have touched on this subject during my previous work term, I really can't say enough about the coop program. In fact, this was one of the things that drew me to the University of Guelph in the first place. Coop adds tremendous value for Computer Science students (or all students in my opinion) in that it allows one to get the practical hands on experience that you won't find in your academic studies. It acts as a perfect complement to put the mainly theoretical, foundation course content to good use.<br><br>\r\n\r\nI largely joined the coop program for the <i>experience</i>. Having 5 different work experiences under my belt when I graduate was obviously very appealing. One thing that I surely underestimated was the amount of networking that comes along with it. The coop program allows students with otherwise very little contact with organizations to get their foot in the door and prove themselves, which is beneficial to both parties involved.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe centralized platform that the coop program provides for finding and receiving job offers is also a nice benefit. It really does streamline the process but it doesn't end there. It is incredibly easy to setup your own placement as well, just as I did this semester. I had heard about the great things that Polar Mobile was accomplishing in the mobile space and I was interested in being a part of it. A few emails later and everything was organized and ready to go for the next 4 months.<br><br>\r\n\r\nNow that I am wrapping up my second work term, I am stunned at the fact that I learned so much, and had so much fun in the process. The coop program certainly lived up to my highest expectations. I got to work with a lot of smart people in a great environment, and ultimately better my future. It is pretty unlikely that any computer science student could ask for more.",

            "content": "As soon as I realized that this work term's report would be an extension of the website that I developed last semester, I was immediately excited. One thing that I did a lot of at Polar Mobile this semester was develop rapid web applications using mysql-backed Django. I wanted to take all that I learned over the period and apply it to a super maintainable portfolio website and over the course of a few weeks, that spawned into what you see before you.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe entire design of the website was built using <a href=\"http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/\">Twitter Bootstrap</a> and a few custom elements. Twitter Bootstrap is an awesome toolkit to make design a secondary focus by including common typography, forms and navigation elements. It allows developers to focus on the core of their product and we used it at Polar Mobile while developing Atlas.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<img class=\"pull-right\" style=\"border: 1px solid #000; margin: 10px;\"  src=\"/static/images/DjangoAdministration.png\"/>\r\n\r\nSince I knew that this website would continue to be updated throughout my next 3 work term semesters, I wanted to build something dynamic that would not require a whole lot of reconstruction. Django turned out to be the perfect tool for the job in this case. One of Django's best features is its easy to use Administration area, which I am actually posting this article from. All of the work term information is dynamic as well in that I can simply add another organization for my subsequent work terms in a matter of button clicks.</div><br><br>\r\n\r\nOne challenging aspect after completing my initial design for this particular website was to find a free/cheap hosting alternative. My old host did not support Django so I sought out something new. I ended up going with  <a href=\"http://code.google.com/appengine/\">Google App Engine</a> which offers fast deployment and development on Google's infrastructure. This meant that the common relational SQL databases that I am used to would not be viable. <a href=\"http://www.allbuttonspressed.com/projects/django-nonrel\">Django nonrel</a> turned out to be the perfect project to tie everything together.<br><br>\r\n\r\nLooking back, I am pretty thrilled to see what I have been able to accomplish all thanks to the coop program and working at Polar Mobile. Working with python and Django certainly put some of the fun back into web development that I seemed to misplace when dealing with the dreaded cross-browser compatibility issues.<br><br>\r\n",
