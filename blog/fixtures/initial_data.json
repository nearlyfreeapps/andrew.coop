      "content": "As hard as I find this to believe, tomorrow will be my last day Polar Mobile. My work term went incredibly fast this semester which in my opinion is a sign of a successful and busy placement. Without a doubt, I learned more than I thought would be possible in such a short amount of time and for that I am grateful. Below I will reflect on a few of the major takeaways from my time at Polar.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<h4>The People</h4>\r\nBuilding a solid team is a difficult thing. Polar Mobile certainly takes pride in choosing the best candidates for individual positions that will really be cohesive with everyone else. In my opinion, the team at Polar Mobile is one of their absolute strengths. I had the privilege of getting to work with a few different individuals on different projects and getting to do this was a definite highlight. I got to absorb not only their code style and problem solving manoeuvres but also the company culture.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<h4>The Place</h4>\r\nOne of the best parts about the coop experience is getting a chance to try something new. The downtown Toronto environment was a perfect transition to really get me out of my comfort zone. It is fairly clear to me that without the coop program, I would not have likely pursued this position based on the location alone. Now that I have done it, I have found that I actually enjoy the daily commute and general atmosphere. <br><br>\r\n\r\n<h4>The Things</h4>\r\nGetting the chance to work on and solve all different sorts of problems at Polar Mobile was by far the most exciting thing. I felt as though they gave me meaningful, interesting tasks that allowed me to grow as a software developer. In reflection, I am very proud and almost astonished at what I did accomplish over my work term. Hardly anything I did this semester involved technology that I was remotely familiar with prior to my work term yet now I am using these things in my own projects simply because they are <em>neat</em>.<br><br>\r\n\r\nOverall, I learned more than I thought imaginable during my placement at Polar Mobile this semester. Programming and software engineering is far more than just jotting down code and getting a chance to experience and understand this so early in my career is extremely valuable. I have been a strong advocate for the coop program since my last work term, and if I keep having experiences like this, I don't think I will stop anytime soon. ",

      "content": "In many respects, comparing my first work term at Voice On The Go with my second work term at Polar Mobile is a difficult task. Polar Mobile is an organization of over double the size of Voice On The Go and it certainly felt that way. In general there were many more hoops to jump through in order to get your code to see with light of day. At Voice On The Go, I always had a clear understanding of who is in charge of what particular aspect of a task. At Polar Mobile, this was lost me. There were times when I had completed a project and I wasn't sure who to report to or what happens next.<br><br>\r\n\r\nHowever, with this extensive process comes great things as well. Since the project changed hands several times, it often would collect a lot of feedback and testing. The code review process at Polar Mobile is something I cannot say enough about. I really did enjoy getting the constructive criticism given that it would improve my code style and thinking regarding certain problems. At Voice On The Go, there was no formal code review process. There seemed to be more of a mentality of \"as long as it works\" where as at Polar Mobile the mentality is \"as long as it is quality\". I really did appreciate that particular mentality because it taught me to not rush my code just to meet deadlines but rather focus on the issue at hand and develop a lasting, maintainable solution that is absent of any ugly hacks. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe overall atmosphere of both organizations was also very much different. Being a small organization, Voice On The Go felt like a close, tight-knit group of people. Polar Mobile, on the other hand, felt slightly more divided by various department or team (which is natural as an organization grows). While I enjoyed my time at Voice On The Go, much of that was due to me making the situation enjoyable. Most came in to get their work done and that was that. At Polar Mobile, they have a very big focus on working hard and playing hard. I was told that precise statement during my interview and it was apparent on my first day. The level of dedication and investment that each person put into projects was very refreshing.<br><br>\r\n\r\nTo wrap up, both of my work term experiences so far have been magnificent. Each placement taught me a very similar set of skills and I believe each subsequent work term will continue building on those from the past. At Voice On The Go, I got to greatly deepen my appreciation and fondness for the iOS platform and at Polar Mobile I got to learn an entirely new technology stack. Looking back, I wouldn't change anything about either work term and <i>the experience was truly invaluable</i>. ",

      "content": "One thing that I tend to brag about when talking about my placement this semester is the work environment. Polar Mobile is a very young company, and as such they are a group of people that really like to have fun. This became very obvious on my first day when a NERF gun fight exploded around 4:00 pm. During my interview, I was told that the general atmosphere was \"Work hard, play hard\" and they certainly did not disappoint. Below, I will outline a few other of the awesome things that made Polar Mobile a very unique and exciting place to work.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<h4>The Office</h4>\r\n<div>\r\n<img style=\"margin-left: 10px; width: 150px; border: 1px solid #000;\" class=\"pull-right\" src=\"/static/images/PolarOffice.jpg\">\r\nPolar Mobile's downtown Toronto headquarters is quite an interesting place itself. It is located on the fourth floor of an apartment building and has a very open concept with developers working in close quarters to one another. I found that this was very effective and certainly did encourage collaboration. Some of the features of the office include a putting green to clear your mind, Xbox 360 hooked up to a projector, mini basketball hoops and cheap vending machines. They really did make a place that people don't really want to leave at night (and they sometimes don't!).</div><br>\r\n\r\n<h4>Team Lunches</h4>\r\nSurrounding Polar's office there is an immense number of restaurants. Through out my placement I got the chance to attend team lunches at several different places. These were always a great time to catch up with everyone on what they had been working on and the food was great as well.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<h4>Lunch & Learn</h4>\r\nEvery couple of weeks, Polar Mobile would organize what they called a \"Lunch & Learn\". Essentially the company would order lunch for everyone and a guest speaker would come in to talk to us. Some of the presentation topics and speakers include: Managing Your Money, Social Media Guru Casie Stewart and Sean Bell, Digital Assets Manager of the CFL. All of the talks were very interesting but I particularly took a lot away from Sean Bell's presentation. It was nice to hear from one of Polar Mobile's clients first hand since as a developer, typically we only get feedback through project managers or customer support.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<h4>Ten Million Download Celebration</h4>\r\nDuring my placement Polar Mobile hit the great accomplishment of crossing the line to 10 million downloads of their applications world wide. This was a very big deal for everyone that had contributed and there was a champagne celebration at 10:30 am to mark the occasion. This was definitely something that was very neat to be a part of.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<h4>Holiday Party</h4>\r\n<div>\r\n<img style=\"margin-left: 10px; width: 200px; border: 1px solid #000;\" class=\"pull-right\" src=\"/static/images/PolarChristmasParty.jpg\">\r\nThe Polar Holiday party is one of the things that I will not forget about my placement. The party was held on a Thursday night at The Success Towers on Harbour Street. The party space itself was really quite impressive featuring a dance area, bar, lounge area and \"cigar room\". Great food and desserts were served and a local DJ had everyone on their feet all night. I got a chance to meet some great people and chat with my coworkers and a fun time was had by everyone who was in attendance. Since I am from outside of Toronto, Polar Mobile even graciously booked me a guest suite for the night.</div><br>\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall, life at Polar Mobile was fantastic. All of the things mentioned above were really the icing on the cake of a great learning experience. The only downside that I can potentially see is that now I will expect nothing less from subsequent coop placements! ",

      "content": "While I have touched on this subject during my previous work term, I really can't say enough about the coop program. In fact, this was one of the things that drew me to the University of Guelph in the first place. Coop adds tremendous value for Computer Science students (or all students in my opinion) in that it allows one to get the practical hands on experience that you won't find in your academic studies. It acts as a perfect complement to put the mainly theoretical, foundation course content to good use.<br><br>\r\n\r\nI largely joined the coop program for the <i>experience</i>. Having 5 different work experiences under my belt when I graduate was obviously very appealing. One thing that I surely underestimated was the amount of networking that comes along with it. The coop program allows students with otherwise very little contact with organizations to get their foot in the door and prove themselves, which is beneficial to both parties involved.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe centralized platform that the coop program provides for finding and receiving job offers is also a nice benefit. It really does streamline the process but it doesn't end there. It is incredibly easy to setup your own placement as well, just as I did this semester. I had heard about the great things that Polar Mobile was accomplishing in the mobile space and I was interested in being a part of it. A few emails later and everything was organized and ready to go for the next 4 months.<br><br>\r\n\r\nNow that I am wrapping up my second work term, I am stunned at the fact that I learned so much, and had so much fun in the process. The coop program certainly lived up to my highest expectations. I got to work with a lot of smart people in a great environment, and ultimately better my future. It is pretty unlikely that any computer science student could ask for more.",

      "content": "As soon as I realized that this work term's report would be an extension of the website that I developed last semester, I was immediately excited. One thing that I did a lot of at Polar Mobile this semester was develop rapid web applications using mysql-backed Django. I wanted to take all that I learned over the period and apply it to a super maintainable portfolio website and over the course of a few weeks, that spawned into what you see before you.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe entire design of the website was built using <a href=\"http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/\">Twitter Bootstrap</a> and a few custom elements. Twitter Bootstrap is an awesome toolkit to make design a secondary focus by including common typography, forms and navigation elements. It allows developers to focus on the core of their product and we used it at Polar Mobile while developing Atlas.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<img class=\"pull-right\" style=\"border: 1px solid #000; margin: 10px;\"  src=\"/static/images/DjangoAdministration.png\"/>\r\n\r\nSince I knew that this website would continue to be updated throughout my next 3 work term semesters, I wanted to build something dynamic that would not require a whole lot of reconstruction. Django turned out to be the perfect tool for the job in this case. One of Django's best features is its easy to use Administration area, which I am actually posting this article from. All of the work term information is dynamic as well in that I can simply add another organization for my subsequent work terms in a matter of button clicks.</div><br><br>\r\n\r\nOne challenging aspect after completing my initial design for this particular website was to find a free/cheap hosting alternative. My old host did not support Django so I sought out something new. I ended up going with  <a href=\"http://code.google.com/appengine/\">Google App Engine</a> which offers fast deployment and development on Google's infrastructure. This meant that the common relational SQL databases that I am used to would not be viable. <a href=\"http://www.allbuttonspressed.com/projects/django-nonrel\">Django nonrel</a> turned out to be the perfect project to tie everything together.<br><br>\r\n\r\nLooking back, I am pretty thrilled to see what I have been able to accomplish all thanks to the coop program and working at Polar Mobile. Working with python and Django certainly put some of the fun back into web development that I seemed to misplace when dealing with the dreaded cross-browser compatibility issues.<br><br>\r\n",
